                Recap is a digital time capsule app that allows users to organize and store collections 
                of photos, videos, audio recordings, and text notes. The capsules are collaborative so 
                users can share and work on them with friends, and once a capsule is finished the user 
                can lock it and choose a date and time for it to be reopened.

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">To confirm the assumptions we had about the 
            problem space, I performed a competitive analysis. This also helped me to identify the main features 
            that competitors are offering and find a unique value proposition (UVP) for ReCap. The competitor 
            lineup consisted of Google Photos, Apple's Shared Albums, and VSCO.

            <div>
              <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">I compared these apps based on four aspects: Collaboration, Social Interaction, Editing Tools, 
                and Search Tool. The features we decided to incorporate based on this analysis were:</p>
              <ul class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small" style="margin-left: 2rem;">
                <li class="padding-block-100">Activity page: View recent interactions and keep up with friends within the app.</li>
                <li class="padding-block-100">Shared Capsules: Add collaborators to a capsule and store shared memories together.</li>
                <li class="padding-block-100">Photo and Video Editing: Adjust or enhance photos and videos captured within the app before storing in a capsule.</li>
                <li class="padding-block-100">Search bar: Find capsule by name or collaborator.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">ReCap offers the main features that competitors are 
            providing along with greater customization options and the ability to store different file types, which sets 
            it apart from the crowd.

              <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">To flesh out the concept of our app further, we 
                mapped out all of the features to be included in our design based on the insights we gathered through 
                the competitive analysis and informal user interviews. These features were translated into functional 
                use cases for our app.

            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
              <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">We then set off individually and prepared rough 
                sketches of what the app should look like to discuss the features that we liked and what could be improved 
                or expanded upon. After we all received feedback on our designs, we were able to finalize decisions about 
                the mapping of the functionalities and the architecture of the app.

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">We started off with wireframes for each of the main 
            use cases: 1) Browse time capsules, 2) Create new time capsule, 3) Add media to time capsule, 4) Give edit 
            permissions to others, 5) Lock time capsule.

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">From there, we discussed how to improve the layout 
            and visual appeal of each screen and made revisions accordingly. In particular, the layout of the home page 
            was initially imagined to have sections for recent and shared capsules highlighted at the top. However, we 
            later realized that it would be more intuitive and generalizable to categorize the capsules according to their 
            state (in progress, locked, and unlocked).

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">The login and signup pages were designed to embody the 
            branding and purpose of the app: to send users back in time where they can revisit past memories. I incorporated 
            retro and space themed elements to allude to the experience of creating and opening a time capsule.
            To add a thoughtful touch, I also designed an onboarding carousel that greets our new users with a brief overview 
            of the app and fun illustrations.

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">We performed usability testing with 10 participants to evaluate 
            the user flows for onboarding, capsule creation, and locking a capsule. An error chart was used to keep track of errors 
            made during each testing session. We found that 6 of our participants  completed all of the flows successfully, 3 
            experienced issues in one flow, and 1 experienced issues in two flows. We also discovered that two of our participants 
            felt that the button colors in the warning message were misleading and almost mistakenly clicked no. This led us to 
            believe that we placed too much emphasis on the "no" button and that the strong color contrast was overkill for error 
            prevention.

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">What did I learn?</p>
          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">1) User research is a must: My team and I were stumped on important 
            design decisions along the way because there were too many ambiguities that we did not address early on with user research. 
            I learned that good design requires a strong understanding of user needs.</p>
          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">2) Test early on: Performing usability testing at the end revealed 
            unexpected insights about our prototype that would have greatly improved the quality of our product had we discovered them 
            sooner. Building in user testing as often and early as possible in my process ensures that I am receptive to feedback and 
            my user's needs.</p>
          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">3) Stick to the essence: Without a clear specification of the product 
            requirements, it can be easy to lose sight of what the core essence of the product is. Defining functional use cases provided 
            constraints that helped us focus on the major features and design a cohesive product.</p>
