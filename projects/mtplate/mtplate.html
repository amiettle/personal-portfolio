              <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">
                Food waste has been a focus among dining hall staff at UCI and the university has several efforts 
                being made to increase sustainability but not enough is being done on the students’ end. Many students are 
                unaware of the impact of their dining habits on the environment and tend to engage in wasteful practices. ‍
                We designed a solution to encourage students to practice sustainability 
                in their everyday lives by recording their food waste and becoming more mindful of their meals.

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">To better understand the problem space, we created 
            a survey and conducted interviews. The survey was sent out to UCI students and alumni to ensure that the 
            potential differences between older students who have experience with the dining halls and newer students 
            with less experience was accounted for. For more detailed insights, I wrote questions to interview dining 
            hall staff about their own experiences with food waste at their workplaces.

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-top-700">Summary of findings:</p>
          <ul class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300" style="margin-left: 2rem;">
            <li>We discovered that almost all students believed that reducing food waste at UCI was very important or at least somewhat.</li>
            <li>Of those students, we found that many of them dine both on and off campus. This led us to believe that an ideal solution may entail decreasing food waste across a wider scope instead of exclusively "on-campus" dining settings.</li>
            <li>However, we ultimately focused our solution on the context of on-campus dining because we found that students who dine at the dining halls reported higher food waste percentages.</li>
            <li>In-depth interviews with two UCI dining hall staff revealed that the dining halls already have in place a few efforts to manage the issue on their end, but only so much can be done when students are sending back plates with piles of unfinished food.</li>

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small">When we performed a competitive analysis to evaluate 
            existing solutions in the market, my team discovered that current trends included food logging systems, meal 
            diaries, and inventory trackers. Strengths amongst our competitors were simple and clean designs and intuitive 
            features that required little effort to learn. However, we found the food recognition AI to be rather 
            inaccurate within our competitors, due to a lack of inclusion and diversity of food items. Lastly, we noticed 
            that embedding social aspects or personalized goals motivates users to keep using the app and logging their 
            food intake.

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">After preparing a few sketches, we collectively 
            gathered the key elements and features to be included in the wireframes. Taking these elements, we created 
            an information architecture to serve as the structure of our app and guide our designs and wireframes.

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">On the landing page we decided to display stats for 
            personal tracking of dining practices and a leaderboard for comparing performance to friends. One of the 
            main functionalities of the app is the meal logging feature. For logging meals, the user takes a picture 
            of the meal before and after completion of the meal. The images are analyzed to get a rough estimate of 
            how much food is left over from the meal. Completed meals are saved in a meal log history grouped by 
            their date.

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">In order to encourage users to log their meals daily, 
            we incorporated a community-like feature called ZotPack that allows users to compete with friends in their pack. 
            Scores are determined by the amount of times a user logs their meals and the calculated food waste percentage. 
            Additionally, daily check in on the app increases their scores, incentivizing consistent usage of the app.

          <p class="ff-body fw-regular fs-small padding-block-300">My team aimed to solve the lack of awareness 
            about on-going food waste concerns and its impact on the environment. Its presence on a university 
            campus is especially significant due to the culture in on-campus dining halls and eateries. Some 
            constraints that we had to keep in mind were that our users are busy students with countless 
            responsibilities, therefore our solution must not impose a burden on their daily lives. A “nudge” 
            in the right direction is what we aimed for our project to accomplish. If I were to expand on this 
            design in the future, I would consider implementing reminders for notifying users to log their meals 
            and designing an onboarding process to ensure a seamless user experience from start to finish. <br><br>
            Overall, I had lots of fun experimenting with new methods in this project and learning how to execute 
            the design process.</p>
